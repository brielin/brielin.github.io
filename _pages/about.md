I am a postdoc at the New York Genome Center, jointly advised by Dr's [David Knowles](https://daklab.github.io/) and [Tuuli Lappalainen](https://tllab.org/). For the first two years of my postdoc, I was funded as a [Data Science Institute Fellow](https://datascience.columbia.edu/research/postdoctoral-researchers/) at Columbia University, where I hold a joint appointment. I am broadly interested in the development and application of statistical and computational methods in genetics and genomics. I am particularly interested in large-scale exploratory data analysis, 'omic data integration, and cross-ancestry analysis.

I received the PhD from the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley in 2016, where I was jointly supervised by Dr's [Lior Pachter](https://pachterlab.github.io/) and [Noah Zaitlen](https://bioscience.ucla.edu/people/noah-zaitlen/). In a past life, I studied [quantum complexity theory](https://csdmp.github.io/docs/brown2011.pdf).
